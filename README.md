# BTE-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Biomedical QA

*Overview*

This repository provides an implementation of the BTE-RAG framework, designed specifically for retrieval-augmented question answering (QA) in biomedical contexts. BTE-RAG leverages explicit mechanistic knowledge retrieval from BioThings Explorer (BTE) to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) on biomedical benchmarks.

## Repository Structure

DMDB_benchmark/: Contains benchmark datasets derived from DrugMechDB, structured for evaluating model performance.

data/analysis_results/: Output data from various analyses conducted using BTE-RAG.

figures/: Repository for storing figures generated during analysis.

kg_rag/: Core code implementing the knowledge graph (KG) augmented retrieval mechanism.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application, usage, and analysis workflows of the BTE-RAG system.
